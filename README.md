# pyth_delete_files
Yeah so as you can see I need to fix this code, I'm new in python and this is my first try on piece of code. Generally I want to count files in folder and if there is > 3 I want to delete all .txt files inside...separately both pieces of code works, I mean counting and delete files, but I have problem to connect them together. Any help is more than welcome :)
